            <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text"> <p>I loved playing video games ever since I was a child and I've always wanted to learn how to make them.   However, I did the most common mistake that most people 
do when they try into game development and that is having too many game ideas with little to no skills with coding,
art, music, etc to bring any of those ideas into reality.  After getting frustrated with failing projects in writing games
in Flash, RPG Maker, etc.  I soon lost that desire and decided to only focus on the computer science aspect of it 
during my highschool/college years.  Still, I would find ways to write small games while learning computer science.
I was satisfied in writing small games such as tic-tac-toe, space invaders, text based story games, etc.</p>
<p>I recently rediscovered that want to once more develop small games as a hobby.  I have no desire to make any money from anything I make,
I just want to have fun making them and be proud of the things I manage to complete.</p>
<p>However there always something I struggle with everytime I try to pick up a hobby and that is</p>
<p><i>consistency</i></p>
<p>So in order to stay consistent to my hobby,  I made this blog.  The hope is that I provide updates as I make progress on my projects to keep me 
motivated to see them to completion.  I'll also talk about video games and other random stuff that I find interesting.  </p>
<p>Let's see how far this goes!</p></p>
